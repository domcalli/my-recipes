First project - Creating a basic recipe website

I'm thinking of making a meal planning site where i can list simple recipes I can make for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. (maybe a snacks section too)

In order to make this I will need to be able to create a well orgaized clear HTML document using all the basics I've learned in the Foundations HTML course.
